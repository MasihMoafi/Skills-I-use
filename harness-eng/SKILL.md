description: "Use when designing, evaluating, or simplifying an agent project harness: AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md rules, startup scripts, progress logs, feature trackers, handoffs, evaluator rubrics, quality documents, repo-local knowledge maps, and mechanical guardrails for coding agents. Especially useful when converting raw agent-workflow notes into a concise, verifiable project control layer."

# Harness Engineering

Use this skill to make an agent-run project easier to start, steer, verify, resume, and improve. Favor local project artifacts over chat-only guidance.

## Core stance

- Build a harness only around a real workflow the user wants repeated.
- Keep the injected instruction file short: it should be a table of contents, not an encyclopedia.
- Move durable knowledge into repo-local docs, scripts, checks, and templates.
- Encode high-value judgment as mechanical checks when possible.
- Every harness component should earn its keep through a clearer start, safer edit, stronger verification, or better handoff.

## First pass

1. Inspect the project locally: root files, existing docs, package scripts, tests, git state, and any existing session/progress files.
2. Identify the agent's repeated failure mode or bottleneck: startup, context discovery, feature selection, verification, review, handoff, architecture drift, or cleanup.
3. Choose the smallest harness surface that fixes that bottleneck.
4. Add or edit only the earmarked artifact. Do not scatter duplicate instructions.
5. Verify the harness by running the cheapest check that proves a future agent can follow it.

## Harness artifacts

Use these only when they fit the project:

- `AGENTS.md`: short operating map, source-of-truth pointers, definition of done, and project-specific guardrails.
- `init.sh`: one command for setup/baseline verification/startup hints. It should print the cwd and fail clearly.
- `progress.md` or `.ES/.../ES.md`: current verified state, blocker, latest verification, next action.
- `feature_list.json`: machine-readable queue when there are multiple user-visible features.
- `session-handoff.md`: compact state transfer after long or risky sessions.
- `clean-state-checklist.md`: end-of-session checks for startup, tests, docs, feature status, and unfinished work.
- `evaluator-rubric.md`: pass/fail scorecard for agent output quality; tune it against human judgment.
- `quality-document.md`: snapshot of product/domain/layer health over time.
- Custom lints/tests: enforce dependency boundaries, schemas, logging, naming, file size, or other rules that agents repeatedly violate.

## Minimal templates

Prefer adapting these sections in place over creating all files by default.

### `AGENTS.md`

```markdown
# Project Agent Rules

## Start Here
- Read this file, then read: <progress/doc paths>.
- Verify cwd: `<expected path or command>`.
- Baseline check: `<test or smoke command>`.

## Work Rules
- Work on one task/feature at a time.
- Keep changes scoped to <area/feature>.
- Preserve <important APIs/contracts>.
- Use <package manager/test command/style command>.

## Definition of Done
- Behavior matches: <acceptance criteria>.
- Verification run: <commands>.
- Evidence recorded in: <progress/handoff path>.
- Known risks or skipped checks are explicitly listed.
```

### Progress state

```markdown
# Progress

Current Verified State:
- Root:
- Startup:
- Verification:
- Highest priority unfinished work:
- Current blocker:

Session Record:
- Date:
- Goal:
- Completed:
- Verification run:
- Evidence:
- Known risks:
- Next best action:
```

### Feature item

```json
{
  "id": "short-id",
  "priority": 1,
  "area": "area-name",
  "title": "User-visible feature",
  "user_visible_behavior": "What should be true when done",
  "status": "not_started",
  "verification": ["Step 1", "Step 2"],
  "evidence": [],
  "notes": ""
}
```

## Evaluation loop

For a new or changed harness, check:

1. Can a fresh agent find the right starting docs in under one minute?
2. Can it run the baseline verification without guessing commands?
3. Is there exactly one current priority or a clear selection rule?
4. Is "done" tied to evidence, not confidence?
5. Is stale or duplicate guidance avoided?
6. Can the harness be simplified without quality dropping?

If unsure whether a component is still needed, take a quality snapshot, remove or bypass one component, run the benchmark/task suite, compare results, and keep the simpler version only if quality does not drop.
